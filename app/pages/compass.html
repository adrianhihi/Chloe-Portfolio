        The Story
      </div>
      <div>
        COMPASS - the first Career Conference for Asians in Silicon Valley will take place at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Silicon Valley in April 2018. The one-day event has a stellar lineup of technical leaders from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Alibaba, Tencent, and other companies, who are passionate about sharing their personal stories and career insights. 
        <br><br>
        The project was created for the conference’s printed and digital communication campaign, aiming at capturing and amplifying an evocative, clear and professional comprehensive brand experience.

        My Role
      </div>
      <div>
        Besides the initial COMPASS design team, five external designers (including me) joined the campaign team. We’ve asked to come up with our own concept and designs for the conference, based on a material requirement doc, a color palette, and the COMPASS Logo. After two rounds of competition, my work was selected.

        The Start
      </div>
      <div>
        I found a description on the COMPASS website and it provided me with a great insight on this event: 
      </div>
      <div>
        Whether you have 8 years, 3 years, or no existing industry experience, you still face unique challenges and opportunities at this current stage of your career. We organized the COMPASS conference so that senior leaders can share their career insights to the broader Asian community and equip them with the right strategies to tackle common challenges as well as embrace new opportunities.

       <div></div>
       <div>
         I started from exploring references and creating self-explaining mood boards to set the right metaphor and visual rhythm for the conference identity.

         Color. Leitmotif. Metaphor.
       </div>
       <div class="text-image">
         <div class="left">
          The color palette was set by the COMPASS team, with 4 color and 4 greys. Although we were given the freedom to add new colors, I started with the pre-defined visual restrictions for two reasons:
          <br><br>
          1. Without the acknowledgment of what color the other designers will add, it will save time for the team to combine my design later if my design is using the most common colors. 
          <br><br>
          2. There are always ways to explore variations, with transparency and appropriate combinations.

        <div>COMPASS team gave 3 choices of font-family: Lato, Avenir, and Raleway. I decided to go with Raleway as it gives a unique stylistic touch.</div>

        Keep it Real

        Aiming at accuracy for the printed matter, the design was tested with real contents, long names and print size.

        Crafts
      </div>
      <div>
        Besides the conference visual system design, I helped with the cardboard collective DIY crafts for the photo booth. We draw outlines by pencil on the cardboard, cut shapes by scissors, and painted with acrylic colors and markers.

        In the end, my design was selected from the five concepts. Due to the tight printing schedule, the COMPASS designer Li Zeng took from here, polished the design and finalized the deliverables. Thanks to Li’s great work, the design deliverables were shipped to print and on display at the conference, welcomed 1,600+ attendees (1,500+ audiences, 48 speakers, and 57 volunteers) on April 8th at Santa Clara Convention Center. 
        <br><br><br>
        The feedback and response we have received were really positive, especially on the arrow metaphor. It was great to see my work brought to life. And the ultimate rewards were seeing a client proud to use the new sets in the marketing campaign and the whole community enjoyed the experience.
        <br><br><br>
        On the big day, I also volunteered and was responsible for the Speaker&VIP reception and attendee communications. This project was a fantastic journey and I was able to see myself having more possibilities and optimism.
