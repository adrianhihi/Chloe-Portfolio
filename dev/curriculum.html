    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">The IT Academy curriculum focuses on the most relevant, real-world software engineering skills, including algorithms, coding fundamentals and principles, object-oriented design, and system design.</p>
    
    <p class="lead">Our unique approach combines real-world examples with academic foundations in a collaborative setting. Our interactive environment allows students to ask/answer questions, discuss their ideas with instructors and students, and receive hands-on assistance.</p>

      <p class="lead">1. Algorithms</p>
      
      <p class="lead">Algorithms are recipes for solving computational problems. You will study fundamental algorithms for solving a variety of problems, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">More importantly, our training focuses on general design and analysis techniques that underlie these algorithms. For example, we will examine divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greediness, and probabilistic approaches.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">You will also learn techniques for analyzing time and space complexity of algorithms and will use these to evaluate real-world tradeoffs.</p>

      <p class="lead">2. Programming Languages</p>
      
      <p class="lead">We focus on basic concepts and solution implementation using various programming languages as examples. A lot of detail is given to the concepts and features of the programming language itself.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">We provide both detailed training on how to understand and utilize the programming languages as an engineering tool to solve real problems and an introduction of some in-depth topics about the programming language itself.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">Both aspects are very important for building up the engineering knowledge and skills for a qualified individual to develop and maintain moderately large programs.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">Time and memory tradeoffs for a variety of methods and data structures will be taught in this class, and the code correctness, efficiency, and style will also be areas of focus.</p>

      <p class="lead">3. Object-Oriented Design</p>
      
      <p class="lead">We review all the important object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Instead of only memorizing “what” these concepts are, you will dive into code extracted from open source projects to learn “how” these are utilized in the real world.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">We will explore how to divide up complicated design problems into a hierarchy of classes and how to define the best interaction between these classes. Detailed examples are used to make the theoretical methods easier to understand.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">We will also introduce common design patterns, and focus on the core motivation of these patterns so that you will understand why these patterns are useful and how they can be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

      <p class="lead">We will introduce basic concepts and common algorithms in large-scale systems. You will learn various challenges for systems with scale, and corresponding design principles. The course covers topics such as distributed storage systems, big data batch processing and stream processing.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">You will dive into design details of popular open-source systems and frameworks (e.g. Hadoop, Cassandra, Spark, and Kafka). You will also have opportunities to use what you have learned to design highly-scalable web applications.</p>

    <h1>Student Projects</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">The goal of the Project courses is to provide students with a comprehensive training of project design and implementation. Our courses cover hot techniques in web development, mobile development, and big data and data science, and enable students to understand the whole lifecycle of project development starting from brainstorming, business design, and engineering design.</p>
    
    <p class="lead">After taking this course, students are expected to have full-stack software development experience, as well as the capabilities to development their own projects with new tech stacks.</p>
