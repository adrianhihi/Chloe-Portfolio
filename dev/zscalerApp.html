        The Challenge
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <div>
          One of the biggest challenges is the need to provide complete, consistent security across devices that you may not own. And because these devices each run on their own operating systems, and change on their own schedule, finding a single way to secure them all has been difficult. Even more problematic, the majority of web traffic from mobile devices comes from apps, not from standard browsers, so threats may not even be visible to traditional security appliances.

          As a  cloud security platform, Zscaler acts as the go-between for users and the internet; we inspect every byte of traffic and ensure that it complies with users’ security policies. Now, with the Zscaler App, directing the user’s web traffic – including app traffic – to Zscaler is as simple as one click.

        Warm Up

      <div>
        Our old Mobile Apps were developed in 2013 and they have been on the market for over 4 years. We started looking into revamping the product in July 2017. Before diving into the new design, I took a step back to familiarize myself with the current services and product.

        While playing around with the app, I took notes on the flow breakpoints and the frustrations of using the app. By reorganizing my notes to create a roadmap of the current app, the confusions involving in each steps arose. During meetings with the larger team, the app analysis helped me gain empathy while explaining my decisions.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <div class="cell-text cell-text-1">
          We got tons of feedback from our customers about how they felt frustrated and insecure whenever they used the app. They stated that, for example, the app required too many taps/gestures to navigate, it was slow to open and load the details page on the app, it contained too much unreadable information, it also had too many technical writings and robotic language, etc. Some words and abbreviations can be understood only by security field engineers or users who are very familiar with the Zscaler product.
        </div>
        <div class="cell-text cell-text-2">
          The current app was designed four years ago and was designed in skeuomorphism style with metal textures and drop shadows. The color set was dark and most of the font were too small to read. The data presentation methods were also out-fashioned.
        </div>
        <div class="cell-text cell-text-3">
          The current app structure is based on a scroll tab bar, which is the main navigation system. The tabs switch between destinations of varying importance within the app. Each tab contained mixed information that was a mess and whose main point was unclear. Similarly, the UI was overloaded and too complex for non-tech-savvy users, with both actual and perceived sub-optimal speed and performance.
        </div>
        <div class="cell-text cell-text-4">
          The Zscaler App works across different operating systems and a variety of devices:  iOS, Android, Windows, etc. However, the current mobile app looks totally different from the desktop app yet they are supposed to represent the same brand and give the same expressions to users. The new design needs to stay consistent across all platforms. It also needs to be simple enough to adapt to all systems regardless of their differences. Furthermore, the new design needs to be able to quickly roll out on all platforms within a tight timeline.
        </div>
        <div class="cell-text cell-text-5">
          Besides the current service, the PMs also asked for a new function - integrate Zscaler Private Access, which is a completely new service for our mobile users. Adapting the new service to the current scope became another challenge.

          After maneuvering through the Z-app, I realized that the previous Z-app emphasized on laying out all data points and every single detail for users to read, rather than even caring about whether the information was actually helpful to them. Most of the product decisions were based on what could be done instead of what should be done.

        Key Goals and Design Considerations

      <div>
        If power users with great reception and tech literacy were having trouble with our tech-savvy marketplace, how bad was the experience in our immature marketplaces with more challenging technological contexts?  The original premise is simple: get connected, get protected, anywhere and anytime. I began to look for the north star:

        An Explicit Information Architecture
      </div>
      <div>
        While cleaning up the current app structure, I started to think about how to adopt the new feature without interrupting the current flow.
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div>
        The first option was to have two sets of functions run parallel to each other and focus on systematizing the experience to be more modular. They would also provide the app with the ability to be more flexible and scalable for future functions. Since users are already familiar with how it works with Web Security, they won’t feel confused if we are reusing the same pattern from Web Security for Private Access. Furthermore, the engineers only need to build a separate system for the new service without messing with the previous set.
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div>
        I explored another direction; treating the two functions as a whole. This is very common in other apps. This option put the two different services together on the same page and the shared features were elevated to independent sections.<br><br>
        There were several back and forth discussions and long debates between PMs, engineers and our design team. In the meantime, I started brainstorming and wire-framing to see how the two structures would work.

        Much like the 5-day sprint suggestions, I started to go through several existing apps to find great patterns for inspiration. Examples included Expedia’s cards with the tab bar, Trulia’s can’t-ignore “Request” button on the bottom, Robinhood’s minimalism line chart, Gmail’s hamburger menu hiding anything else, Apple Clock’s Bedtime section having a big circle showing your schedule.
        <br><br>
        What I liked best about the Apple Clock’s Bedtime was its focus on showing the current status of your schedule, as well as the turn on/turn off switch.
      </div>
      <div>
        A Minimal Approach
      </div>
      <div>
        We feared that the new Private Access service would cause confusion because it was fundamentally a different thing. Fortunately, familiarity makes people feel safe. I decided to put the two services next to each other and make them look and feel the same. 
        <br><br>
        After exploring variations, I narrowed down to 3 options and created iterations with more details. If the new goal was to simplify the entire app, the home screen needed to inspire action and only reveal valuable information to the user. 
      </div>

        The interface had to be logically structured with the most important information up front, and detailed information and actions secondary. Things that people used the most should be the most readily accessible, and more detailed interactions should require one extra step, allowing us to create a simple up-front impression that didn’t overwhelm with information and interactions only occasionally needed. 
        <br><br>
        Always trying to radically simplify: What is the most important thing a person needs to implicitly understand in order to use a feature successfully? Instead of over-communcating we would focus on telling a more human story, an interface that you could read. We decided to go with the third option.

        After settling on the perfect home screen, the information also fell into place. I went through the other sections and completed the flow.

        Material Design

      <div>
        I employed Material Design on the app. To maintain consistency with all Zscaler products, I used our main font - Helvetica Neue. To reduce the visual noises, I picked 15 colors from our 65 color palette.

      It usually takes seconds for our services to find the appropriate cloud and set up the tunnel. Once it gets connected, the services start running in the back and users can leave the app at anytime. A key design challenge was to consider how much emphasis should be given to this ‘always running’ state. How could the user be aware that the app is protecting them at all times? 
      <br><br>
      In addition to show the real-time upload/download usages and the network activity’s ups and downs, I explored animations to inspire confidence and to gain clientele. This was the selected iteration.

          A Fresh Identity
      </div>
      <div>
          In the previous version, the app only represented Zscaler and used Zscaler’s logo as its icon. Now, we have partnered with vendors like Verizon and T-mobile, and we need to consider white-labeling and rebranding. The new icon should have the ability to represent the app itself and accommodate future potentials. I explored 5 options with different perspectives. In the end, we chose the one with a shield (to bring about the notion of security) and a leaf (to inspire healthy access).

        The redesign idea actually born and grew since almost two years ago. Strong arguments, technical feasibilities, limited bandwidth, and massive requirements from clients, the evolution process was stretched again and again. Several PMs, managers and engineering teams involved, even the CEO. We had big visions, strong aspirations and we wanted to get there fast. While we see that few large companies really have the ability to invest enormous resources and build something utterly powerful and great, most starts with a small step. You can design the compelling interface and fascinating experience, but you can’t just launch it right away. Moving toward something that can be delivered needs practical goals and reasonable scope. You have to start somewhere. In our experience, starting at the bottom is a very practical way to move forward.
